#### Requirements

Create a function/method that can assess a list of webservers and then returns
a server with the lowest priority. Also create a unit test that can check if
the function/method works as expected.

- A `findServer()` function which returns a Promise that either:
  - Resolves and return an online server with the lowest priority.
  - Reject with an error if no servers are online.
- The HTTP server requests should be used to check if the server is online or offline depending on the following requirements:
  - All server GET requests should be run in parallel.
  - The GET request should timeout after 5 seconds.
  - When the GET request responds with a status code of 200-299, it is considered online.
- A unit test that checks all the underlying components/requirements.
  - The server requests should be mocked.
